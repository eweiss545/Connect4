# Connect4
Allows players to play a game of Connect4 with each other, or play against a computer.

Pretty self-explanatory. You can either play against yourself or a friend, or play against an AI Player. 

To play against yourself, set up two players p1 = Player ('X'), p2 = Player ('O') and then run connect_four(p1, p2). 

To play against an AI Player looking 2 plays ahead, set up p1 = Player ('X') and p2 = AIPlayer('O', 'LEFT', 2) and run connect_four. You can also run AIPlayers against each other, etc.
